I could make the link between C9 and Github,it does not work for some reason I tried everything I knew and what I searched on Google.
So,I downloaded the project from C9 and uploaded it on Github.The link for the C9 project:https://ide.c9.io/dragosion/project-api_spotify_songs
I did the backend part and very few stuff on the frontend part.
